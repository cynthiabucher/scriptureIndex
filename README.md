This notebook is my extensive work of copy/paste scrapbooking.  The contents are: screen clippings, hyperlinks, and pictures of ancient scrolls, archeological object finds, codices, tablets, slabs and seals, that are presented in various translations available on the internet.  I try not to give my personal opinions too much. I change the content often adding and deleting or organizing stuff the best I can to make it more presentable.
My whole object of sharing this is to leave breadcrumbs for others to follow that are also seeking knowledge, or where to find it, in their personal search for the truth. I am working on a regular website to display all the contents of this notebook, but the fear of legal issues regarding copywrite laws and financial obstacles prevent me from this progress.
